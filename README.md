# neADMM: Nonconvex Generalization of ADMM for Nonlinear Equality Constrained Problems

This is the source code of the nonlinear-equality Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (neADMM).
The codes of this paper are in two folders:
1. numerical examples folder contains two source files example1.m and example2.m.
2. Application folder contains source codes for two applications: 
for 1-bit compressive sensing, run the file main.m. 
for vaccine adverse event detection, run the file main.m.
